You can also modify the package downloaded from npm but this is not recommended.</p>\n<p>The file is located on the following folder :</p>\n<pre><code>Server/public/catalog.json\n</code></pre><p>By default, it looks like this :</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"includeSocketIO\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n        { \"id\": \"CONSOLE\", \"name\": \"Interactive Console\", \"panel\": \"bottom\", \"foldername\" : \"interactiveConsole\"},\n        { \"id\": \"DOM\", \"name\": \"Dom Explorer\", \"panel\": \"top\", \"foldername\" : \"domExplorer\" },\n        { \"id\": \"MODERNIZR\", \"name\": \"Modernizr\",\"panel\": \"bottom\", \"foldername\" : \"modernizrReport\" },\n        { \"id\" : \"OBJEXPLORER\", \"name\" : \"Obj. Explorer\",\"panel\": \"top\", \"foldername\" : \"objectExplorer\" }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre><p>It is obviously using the JSON (JavaScript Simple Object Notation) format and is easy to understand: each line in the \"plugins\" array represents a plugin.</p>\n<p>For instance, you can change the folder where the plugin is installed. This folder has to be located under:</p>\n<pre><code>Server/public/vorlon/plugins\n</code></pre><p>By convention, this name needs to be the same as the JavaScript file for the plugin for either the max file:</p>\n<pre><code>{FOLDERNAME}.js\n</code></pre><p>and the min version:</p>\n<pre><code>{FOLDERNAME}.min.js\n</code></pre><p>You can also choose in which panel the plugin should be displayed using the \"panel\" property. It can be either \"bottom\" or \"top\".</p>\n<p>You can add and remove plugins here. \nIt will impact the dashbard by not displaying a removed plugin and also the client JavaScript file which is sent to the client website.</p>\n<p>We also added the option to NOT automatically include socket.io in the script returned to the client. You can disable socket.io embedding by setting:</p>\n<pre><code>\"includeSocketIO\": false\n</code></pre>","headers":[{"depth":"1","title":"Installing Vorlon.JS","slug":"installing-vorlonjs"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Server","slug":"vorlonjs-server"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Client","slug":"vorlonjs-client"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Client advanced topics","slug":"vorlonjs-client-advanced-topics"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Server advanced topics","slug":"vorlonjs-server-advanced-topics"}]},{"meta":{"section":"dashboard","title":"Vorlon.JS Dashboard","sequence":2},"html":"<a name=\"vorlonjs-dashboard\"></a><h1>Vorlon.JS Dashboard</h1>\n<p>The Vorlon.JS dashboard is designed to help debug and test remote JavaScript applications and the UI is geared towards that goal.

It should extend from the <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/microsoft/Plugins/Vorlon/vorlon.plugin.ts\">Vorlon.Plugin class</a>. It may also load <code>html</code> and <code>css</code> into the dashboard to define a panel. You can then write code for both the dashboard and client that can communicate bidirectionally to create whatever features you need.</p>\n<p>To make it easy to get started, we’ve created a sample plugin. This adds an input field to the dashboard, that, when you type something and hit return, sends the message to your client browser, which will reverse the string and send it back, to be rendered in the dashboard. It’s just a simple example to show you how to create and communicate in a plugin. You should <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/Plugins/Vorlon/plugins/sample/README.md\">check the sample plugin’s readme</a> for information about how to enable it, and then <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/Plugins/Vorlon/plugins/sample/sample.ts\">read the sample plugin’s code</a> to see how you might modify it for your own needs.</p>\n<a name=\"installing-plugins\"></a><h2 id=\"installing-plugins\">Installing Plugins</h2>\n<p>We are still working on making it easy to install and run third-party plugins for Vorlon.JS.
