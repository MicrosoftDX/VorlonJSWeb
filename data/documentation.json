You can also modify the package downloaded from npm but this is not recommended.</p>\n<p>The file is located on the following folder :</p>\n<pre><code>Server/config.json\n</code></pre><p>By default, it looks like this :</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"includeSocketIO\": true,\n    \"useSSLAzure\": false,\n    \"useSSL\": true,\n    \"SSLkey\": \"cert/server.key\",\n    \"SSLcert\": \"cert/server.crt\",\n    \"plugins\": [\n        { \"id\": \"CONSOLE\", \"name\": \"Interactive Console\", \"panel\": \"bottom\", \"foldername\" : \"interactiveConsole\", \"enabled\": true},\n        { \"id\": \"DOM\", \"name\": \"Dom Explorer\", \"panel\": \"top\", \"foldername\" : \"domExplorer\", \"enabled\": true },\n        { \"id\": \"MODERNIZR\", \"name\": \"Modernizr\",\"panel\": \"bottom\", \"foldername\" : \"modernizrReport\", \"enabled\": true },\n        { \"id\" : \"OBJEXPLORER\", \"name\" : \"Obj.

This folder has to be located under:</p>\n<pre><code>Server/public/vorlon/plugins\n</code></pre><p>By convention, this name needs to be the same as the JavaScript file for the plugin for either the max file:</p>\n<pre><code>{FOLDERNAME}.js\n</code></pre><p>and the min version:</p>\n<pre><code>{FOLDERNAME}.min.js\n</code></pre><p>You can also choose in which panel the plugin should be displayed using the \"panel\" property. It can be either \"bottom\" or \"top\".</p>\n<p>You can add and remove plugins here. \nIt will impact the dashbard by not displaying a removed plugin and also the client JavaScript file which is sent to the client website.</p>\n<p>We also added the option to NOT automatically include socket.io in the script returned to the client. You can disable socket.io embedding by setting:</p>\n<pre><code>\"includeSocketIO\": false\n</code></pre><p>If you want to support SSL and HTTPS, you just have to set \"useSSL\" to true and then define SSLKey and SSLcert files.</p>\n<a name=\"configure-base-url\"></a><h2 id=\"configure-base-url\">Configure base URL</h2>\n<p>You can change the base URL path in config.json.</p>\n<pre><code>\"baseURL\": \"/your/directory\"\n</code></pre><a name=\"configure-authentication\"></a><h2 id=\"configure-authentication\">Configure authentication</h2>\n<p>You can activate a basic authentication on the Vorlon.js dashboard by adding 3 values to the config.json file.</p>\n<pre><code>\"activateAuth\": true,\n\"username\": \"CHANGEHERE\",\n\"password\": \"CHANGEHERE\"\n</code></pre><p>If the \"activateAuth\" is set to true, you will be redirected to the login page on the first navigation on the dashboard.\nYou then need to give the information set on the \"username\" et \"password\" settings value.</p>\n<p>This allows you to configure a remote Vorlon.js dashboard without risking everyone to access it.</p>\n<a name=\"ssl-support\"></a><h2 id=\"ssl-support\">SSL Support</h2>\n<p>If you want to run the server with SSL support proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install Vorlonjs following the steps in Easy Setup</li>\n<li>Navigate to the installation folder</li>\n<li>Modify JSON file to activate SSL support</li>\n<li>In JSON file set to true </li>\n<li>If you want to replace our localhost certificate should only change the path of the files with the private key and certificate</li>\n<li>Exit and save JSON file<pre><code>  {\n      \"useSSLAzure: false,\n      \"useSSL\": true,\n      \"SSLkey\": \"server/cert/server.key\",\n      \"SSLcert\": \"server/cert/server.crt\",\n      \"includeSocketIO\": true,\n      \"plugins\": \n          ...\n  }\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"ssl-support-on-azure\"></a><h2 id=\"ssl-support-on-azure\">SSL Support on Azure</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to the installation folder</li>\n<li>Modify JSON file to activate SSLAzure support</li>\n<li>In JSON file set to true</li>\n<li>Exit and save JSON file</li>\n<li>Navigate with https protole on your Azure WebSite<pre><code>  {\n      \"useSSLAzure: true,\n      \"useSSL\": false,\n      \"SSLkey\": \"\",\n      \"SSLcert\": \"\",\n      \"includeSocketIO\": true,\n      \"plugins\": \n      ...\n  }\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"configure-vorlon-behind-a-nginx-proxy\"></a><h2 id=\"configure-vorlon-behind-a-nginx-proxy\">Configure Vorlon behind a Nginx proxy</h2>\n<p>Edit your nginx.conf, find <strong>server {</strong> and use this (don't forget to change the paths below to your own paths).</p>\n<pre><code>server {\n\n    server_name  vorlon;\n\n    location ~ ^/(fonts/|images/|javascripts/|stylesheets/|vorlon/|vorlon.dashboardManager.js|robots.txt|humans.txt|favicon.ico) {\n             root /PATH/TO/Vorlonjs/Server/public;\n             access_log off;\n             expires 24h;\n    }\n\n    location /test {\n             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n             proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n             proxy_http_version 1.1;\n             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n             proxy_set_header Host      $host;\n             proxy_pass http://localhost:1337;\n    }\n\n    location /socket.io {\n             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n             proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n             proxy_http_version 1.1;\n             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n             proxy_set_header Host      $host;\n             proxy_pass http://localhost:1337;\n    }\n</code></pre>","headers":[{"depth":"1","title":"Installing Vorlon.JS","slug":"installing-vorlonjs"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Server","slug":"vorlonjs-server"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Client","slug":"vorlonjs-client"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Client advanced topics","slug":"vorlonjs-client-advanced-topics"},{"depth":"2","title":"Vorlon.JS Server advanced topics","slug":"vorlonjs-server-advanced-topics"},{"depth":"2","title":"Configure base URL","slug":"configure-base-url"},{"depth":"2","title":"Configure authentication","slug":"configure-authentication"},{"depth":"2","title":"SSL Support","slug":"ssl-support"},{"depth":"2","title":"SSL Support on Azure","slug":"ssl-support-on-azure"},{"depth":"2","title":"Configure Vorlon behind a Nginx proxy","slug":"configure-vorlon-behind-a-nginx-proxy"}]},{"meta":{"section":"dashboard","title":"Vorlon.JS Dashboard","sequence":2},"html":"<a name=\"vorlonjs-dashboard\"></a><h1>Vorlon.JS Dashboard</h1>\n<p>The Vorlon.JS dashboard is designed to help debug and test remote JavaScript applications and the UI is geared towards that goal.

This adds an input field to the dashboard, that, when you type something and hit return, sends the message to your client browser, which will reverse the string and send it back, to be rendered in the dashboard. It’s just a simple example to show you how to create and communicate in a plugin. You should <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/Plugins/Vorlon/plugins/sample/README.md\">check the sample plugin’s readme</a> for information about how to enable it, and then <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/Plugins/Vorlon/plugins/sample/vorlon.sample.client.ts\">read the sample client plugin’s code</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/blob/master/Plugins/Vorlon/plugins/sample/vorlon.sample.dashboard.ts\">sample dashboard plugin's code</a> to see how you might modify it for your own needs.</p>\n<a name=\"installing-plugins\"></a><h2 id=\"installing-plugins\">Installing Plugins</h2>\n<p>We are still working on making it easy to install and run third-party plugins for Vorlon.JS.

When the proxy is called with a target url, it will forward this http call (and all subsequent calls) to the target. The proxy will injects Vorlon's client script in the page for you in the meantime. To manage subsequent calls for resources from the website (like css, scripts, images, ...), the proxy create a cookie on first call with the target url. The (necessary) use of a cookie means that it is unadvised to run multiple Vorlon inspection using proxy with the same browser instance (because this cookie will be shared among browser tabs).</p>\n<a name=\"running-proxy-locally\"></a><h2 id=\"running-proxy-locally\">Running proxy locally</h2>\n<p>First you must check that the proxy has been enabled. Open config.json and verify that \"enableWebproxy\" is set to true, and start your Vorlon server (using \"npm start\" for example). That's the only thing you must have to do. If you run the proxy locally, you could go to <a href=\"http://localhost:1337/httpproxy\">http://localhost:1337/httpproxy</a> to open a helper page. The proxy itself will listen on port 5050 (by default). In case of trouble, look at the console for your server. At the very beginning you must have a trace indicating that the server and the proxy have started, and which port they are running on.</p>\n<a name=\"hosting-the-proxy\"></a><h2 id=\"hosting-the-proxy\">hosting the proxy</h2>\n<p>Vorlon server and proxy resides on different processes and could be deployed separately. To work properly, the proxy must be listening at the root of a http domain. The proxy cannot work if it's set on a path like \"<a href=\"http://vorlonjs.com/documentation/\">http://vorlonjs.com/documentation/</a>\". This is due to the fact that inspected web pages may have url relative to the httpdomain (url starting with \"/\"). If the proxy is not listening at the root, it won't be able to catch those calls.</p>\n<p>If you want to host a Vorlon instance with the proxy feature, their are a few configurations that you may find usefull :\n\"vorlonServerURL\" is used by the proxy to build the url of Vorlon client script\n\"vorlonProxyURL\" is used by the Vorlon server to send requests to the proxy</p>\n<p>if empty, \"vorlonServerURL\" and \"vorlonProxyURL\" default to localhost with the proper port.</p>\n","headers":[{"depth":"1","title":"Vorlon proxy","slug":"vorlon-proxy"},{"depth":"2","title":"How does it work ?","slug":"how-does-it-work"},{"depth":"2","title":"Running proxy locally","slug":"running-proxy-locally"},{"depth":"2","title":"hosting the proxy","slug":"hosting-the-proxy"}]},{"meta":{"section":"contributing","title":"Contributing","sequence":6},"html":"<a name=\"contributing\"></a><h1>Contributing</h1>\n<p>Vorlon.JS is a fully open source project.
