## Vorlon.JS Server

To get started using Vorlon.JS you will need to install it from npm:

    $ npm i -g vorlon

Once Vorlon.JS is done installing, you can now run the server:

    $ vorlon
    The Vorlon server is running

With the server running, open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) in your browser to see the Vorlon.JS dashboard.

## Vorlon.JS Client

Before you can start debugging your app you have to enable it to communicate to the Vorlon.JS Server by adding this script tag to your applicationâ€™s html:

    <script src="http://localhost:1337/vorlon.js"></script>

You can also open the [sample page](http://cdn.rawgit.com/MicrosoftDX/Vorlonjs/master/Plugins/samples/index.html) to test that your dashboard is working. You should see the client appear in your dashboard when you open that page.
