The Vorlon.JS dashboard is designed to help debug and test remote JavaScript applications and the UI is geared towards that goal. The dashboard has two major sections, the client summary view and the plugin view.

The client summary view shows what the current session and client id are currently active and a list of available clients that you can work with. The ```Identify a client``` button quickly allows you to see which remote client browser tab or window you are currently working with.

The plugin view is where all the action is! The console is the only plugin that has a fixed location at the bottom of the dashboard and all other plugins will present themselves across the top as tabs.
